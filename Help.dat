JSciCalc
**********************************************************************
A Scientific Calculator cum Graph Software Developed in Java.
**********************************************************************
Instructions-

1. The minimum screen resolution for viewing the complete calculator and graph 
program is 1024x768. With a lower resolution, the complete program cant be viewed.

2.The number representation in the output display is in terms of integers, but for 
very large and small numbers, the exponential format is used to be able to display 
a larger range of numbers. Eg. 4.5425E32 represents 4.5425 multiplied by 10 raised 
to the power 32. Same goes for negative exponents.

3.Buttons are provided for all the numbers and functions. Clicking on the button with
the mouse displays the respective number or function in the input display box, and 
adds it to the input expression. Operator precedence is supported, so the complete 
expression can be entered at once. To evaluate the expression, press the = button, 
and the result is displayed in the output display box.

4.Operator precedence is as follows in increasing order-
•	Addition ( + ), Subtraction ( - )
•	Multiplication ( * ), Division ( / )
•	To the power ( ^) , sqre, sqrt, cbrt, cube
•	sin(), cos(), tan(), arcsin(), arcos(), arctan(), sinh(), cosh(), tanh()
•	Factorial ( ! )
•	Parentheses ( )
eg. 1+2*3 gives the result 7. 1*2+3 gives the result 5.

5. To use the functions provided, press the corresponding function  button, and then 
the number. eg. to calculate the sin of 5 radians, press the sin button and then press 
5, followed by =. Use brackets wherever applicable. However excess brackets may 
also lead to unexpected results!! So use only the required number of brackets.

6.To find negative exponents, use 0- the exponent. Eg. To find 12 raised to the power
 -5, write 12^(0-5). Unary – operator is not supported in all cases, so this is always 
the better option. To find the graph of e raised to the power –x, write e^(0-x). 

7.For operation of many rational numbers simultaneously, it is advisable to split the 
expression if the number of operands is large, say around 15. Overflow might occur 
in that case. For integers, a far higher number of operands can be simultaneously 
operated upon.

8.The button AC clears both the displays simultaneously, whereas DEL button acts 
more like backspace, it deletes one digit in the input display at a time. 

9.The operator for multiplication is *, it should not be confused with the variable x.

10.The output is displayed in the output diplay box, but if you want to use the result 
or the output in a further calculation, the button ANS has been provided, it clears 
the input display box and displays the answer in the input box itself.

11.There are 2 modes for entering the angles for trigonometric functions- Radians 
and Degrees. The default mode is radians, if you want to change it, the 
corresponding radio button can be clicked.

12. 2 constants- e and pi have been provided. Whenever you want to use either of 
them, just click the corresponding button, and they can be used as many times as 
you want by clicking repeatedly.

13. For memory functions, 3 buttons M, RM, CM have been provided. M calculates
the input expression and stores it in memory. No storage in memory takes place if 
there is no calculation involved. So if you want to store the number 6 in memory, 
write 6*1, then press = button, and press the M button to store it in memory. 
RM retrieves the number stored in memory and appends it to the input expression. 
CM clears the current memory. The memory gets wiped when the program is closed.

14. Under the menu labelled Extras, additional features like Graph, Determinant of 
a matrix, Inverse of a matrix, and Solution of simulataneous linear equations has 
been provided. Clicking on the MenuItems invokes the corresponding application in
another external window. Close the external windows when not required.

15. 3 different types of graphs can be drawn- y=f(x), x=f(y) and parametric curves 
of the type x=f(t),y=g(t). So 3 corresponding text boxes are provided to enter the 
functions, and clicking the Draw Graph button draws the graph on the grid area. 
Moving the mouse pointer on the grid area displays the coordinates of the current 
mouse position depending on the chosen scale. A different number of scales have 
been provided to provide varying levels of zoom, but all graphs cant be viewed 
equally well in all scales. To enter the function, use the keyboard. Trigonometric, 
exponential, logarithmic and other functions applicable in the Calculator are also 
applicable in the Graph. Operator precedence is followed as before. For y=f(x), x is 
the only variable that can be entered, everything else is a constant. For x=f(y), y is 
the only variable, and for x=f(t), y=g(t), t is the only variable. The function, variable 
names are all case sensitive, use only small letters. If insufficient data is provided, 
an error message is displayed in the lowest box. Equations involving both x and y 
are not supported. And if in doubt regarding the correct function names, check the 
display in the calculator.When not required, close the graph window.

16. To find the determinant of a matrix, click on the corresponding MenuItem under
Extras Menu. Choose the degree of the matrix. Then enter the elements of the 
matrix. Only numbers can be entered, not functions and no element should be empty.
 After filling in all the boxes(elements of the matrix), click the Button Calculate, and 
the determinant of the matrix is displayed in the Determinant box. To return to the 
main menu, click on Home button.

17. To find the Inverse of a matrix, click on the corresponding MenuItem under 
Extras Menu. Choose the degree of the matrix, then enter the elements of the 
matrix. Only numbers can be entered, and again, no element should be empty. 
After filling in all the boxes(elements of the matrix), click the Button Calculate, 
and the Inverse of the matrix is displayed under the Inverse of the Matrix label, 
element by element. To return to main menu, click on Home button.

18. To find the solutions of simultaneous linear equations, click on the corresponding
 MenuItem under Extras Menu. Choose the number of variables in the equations. 
Then enter the coefficients of the variables in the equations, and no element should 
be empty, and only numbers can be entered. After entering the coefficients, click on 
the button Solve, and the solution to the system of equations is displayed. If the 
solution is displayed as NaN, that means that the system of equations has no 
solution.

19. Real time help has been provided, ie. when the mouse pointer is moved on the 
calculator screen, then the use or function of the component on which the mouse is 
pointing, is displayed in a box. By default, real-time help is turned ON. To turn it off,
a Checkbox option in the Help menu is provided. By clicking on the option, 
Real-Time Help can be turned ON or OFF.

20. On clicking on the menu item Exit under File menu, the program exits.
