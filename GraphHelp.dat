Help for Graph

Instructions-

1.The use of the Graph application is to draw the Graph of the function entered by
   the user.

2. 3 types of graphs can be drawn by this application-

1.)Curves of the type y=f(x), where the user enters f(x) in the corresponding text box.
 f(x) can be any function of x, but only x, like sinx, cosx, logx, x*sinx, x^2 and so on.
The variable is case sensitive, so writing X will not give the required graph. 
Functions of x and y, like f(x)=x*y+3*y^2  are not supported.
2.)Curves of the type x=f(y), where the user enters x=f(y) in the corresponding text 
box.f(y) can be any function of y, but only y, like siny, tany, lny, y*cosy, y^3 and so 
on. The variable is case sensitive, so writing Y will not give the required graph. Like
before, functions of x and y, like f(x)=x*y+3*y^2  are not supported.
3.)Parametric curves of the type x=f(t), y=g(t), where x is a function of t, and y is a 
function of t. t is the only variable allowed, x and y are also not allowed here. Curves
like circle, ellipse can be drawn in this way, eg. the parametric equation of circle is 
x=sint, y=cost, parametric equation of ellipse is x=2*sint, y=3*cost, and other 
numbers can be substituted in the place of 2 and 3, according to the major and minor 
axes.

3.After entering the required function in the corresponding text box, click on the 
Draw Graph button to draw the graph.

4.If insufficient data is entered, then an error message is flashed in a lower text box.

5.Operator precedence is present as in Scientific Calculator, so enter the function
accordingly. All the functions given in the Scientific Calculator are supported, but the
user has to enter the functions on his own, since no buttons are present. And since 
all the functions are case sensitive, the user needs to be careful while entering the 
functions.

6.For the graph to be drawn of a function, some calculation has to take place. If no 
calculation is present, then no graph gets drawn. eg. to draw the graph of y=x, in the 
text box of f(x), enter x*1. Similarly for the other 2 types of graphs. To draw the 
graph of y=6, in the box corresponding to f(y)=, enter 6*1.

7.On moving the mouse pointer on the Graph grid area, the coordinates of the mouse
with respect to the grid and the scale is displayed in the Coordinates box.

8. To change the Scale of the graph, scroll down the list of scales, and double click 
on the required scale. The graph is appropriately redrawn. However all graphs cant 
be drawn in all scales. A scale of 1:1 means that 1 unit of the graph corresponds to 1
square unit, with the side equal to 1 unit, similarly for scale 5:1, 1 square box in the 
graph corresponds to 25 square units, with each side equal to 5 units.

9. Here speed has been sacrificed for accuracy, so the graph may get drawn a bit 
slowly on slower systems, so that the graph looks sharper and crisper!!
